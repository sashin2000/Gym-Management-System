# Gym-Management-System

We all know that exercise is an important factor for a healthy life. Physical fitness is important not
only for making people fit but also to build a good personality. Fitness gym is one of the best places for
gaining fitness. When so many different types of people are coming for the gym, it is very crucial for gym
manger to manage members. So in this project I have supposed to develop a gym management
system in order to make the management tasks more easier for the gym manager.

Here, gym manager is able to,

* Add member
* Delete member
* Sort members according to their names
* Print members
* Save
* Search a member by membership number

Front end - JavaFX

Backend - Java with MongoDB
